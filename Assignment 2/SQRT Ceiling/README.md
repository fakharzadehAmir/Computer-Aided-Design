# SQRT Ceiling
Write a program that takes a 10-bit std_logic_vector as input and returns the ceiling value of the square root of the input number.

**Example**  

**Input:**  
"0001110000"  
**Output:**  
The expression above represents the number 112. If we take the square root of that number, the approximate result is 58.10. The ceiling of this number is 11, which can be represented as "001011".
