# Unary to Binary Conversion
Design a circuit that takes a 16-bit unary number as input and converts it to a 4-bit binary number. You can use the else-when construct for this purpose.


**Example**
- The unary number 0100 is equivalent to the binary number 0000.
- The unary number 1000 is equivalent to the binary number 1111.
