# Binary Block Analyzer  
Design a circuit that takes an n-bit binary input and determines the index positions of the first and last consecutive blocks of zeros. Then, output the number of ones between the first block and the next block after it, and the number of zeros between the last block and the previous block before it. Represent the output as a binary string.

### Example:  

**Input:** 001111000000111110001  

**Output:**
